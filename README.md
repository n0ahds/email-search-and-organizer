# email-search-and-organizer
Python application to search and organize your emails.

## Running the program
Ensure that you have the Outlook desktop setup with email address.

The program generates a JSON and CSV file with the contents of your inbox.

You'll need to split the data into two files, one training set and one testing set, and set the spam values manually. (The spam values are assigned at random when file is generated).
